1) First of all you are having multiple(30) products in the inventory on which you have to perform the functionalities.
2) You can add anything you want in that inventory. As I designed in such a way that anyone can add any product according to his/her wish.
3) If you add extra quantity of particular product and if the product exists then it automatically increases the quantity and updates it to the inventory.
4) If you wanna purchase any item it automatically provides you the billing amount along with the decrement in the quantity.
